# Identity Sample for Azure AD B2C - Video Calling

This repository contains an ASP.NET Core project which demonstrates video calling using [Azure Communication Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/) in a web application secured by [Azure Active Directory B2C](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory-b2c/).

**IMPORTANT NOTE: The code in this repository is _not_ production-ready. It serves only to demonstrate the main points via minimal working code, and contains no exception handling or other special cases. Refer to the official documentation and samples for more information. Similarly, by design, it does not implement any caching or data persistence (e.g. to a database) to minimize the concepts and technologies being used.**
